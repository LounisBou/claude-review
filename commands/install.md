Run `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/install.sh` and report its output to the user verbatim.

The script writes nothing. It verifies that the three plugins this one builds on are
installed **and enabled**, that python3, curl and a GitHub token are
available, and that the working directory is a GitHub repository clone. On failure it
prints the exact command that fixes the first problem it found.

Installed and enabled are different things: a plugin can sit on disk and be inert,
which is why the check reads the `enabledPlugins` map rather than looking for files.
